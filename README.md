# Awesome dotfiles

A curated list of dotfiles resources. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
Note that some articles or tools may look old or old-fashioned, but this usually means they're battle-tested and mature
(like dotfiles themselves). Feel free to propose new articles, projects or tools!

## Find dotfiles repos

There are many great dotfiles repos out there, each containing their own inspiration and gems. One way to go through
them is to [search GitHub for "dotfiles"](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Repositories).

Also see:

- [Google for "dotfiles"](https://www.google.nl/search?q=dotfiles)
- [Archlinux collection](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles)
- Tip: search for a filename on GitHub, e.g.
  [in:path .gitconfig](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=Code&q=in%3Apath+.gitconfig).
