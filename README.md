# Awesome dotfiles

A curated list of dotfiles resources. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
Note that some articles or tools may look old or old-fashioned, but this usually means they're battle-tested and mature
(like dotfiles themselves). Feel free to propose new articles, projects or tools!

## Find dotfiles repos

There are many great dotfiles repos out there, each containing their own inspiration and gems. I think one of the best
ways to go through them is by [searching GitHub for "dotfiles"](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Repositories).

Also see:

- [Google for "dotfiles"](https://www.google.nl/search?q=dotfiles)
- [Archlinux collection](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles)
- Tip: search for a filename on GitHub, e.g.
  [in:path .gitconfig](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=Code&q=in%3Apath+.gitconfig).

## Example dotfiles repos

A collection of the most popular, well-maintained, and collaborative dotfiles repositories & frameworks. Some projects
contain just the dotfiles. Others go further by allowing you to easily add your own custom dotfiles, and/or including
scripts to manage dotfiles/plugins.
