## Find dotfiles repos

There are many great dotfiles repos out there, each containing their own inspiration and gems. I think one of the best ways to go through them is by [searching GitHub for "dotfiles"](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Repositories).

Also see:

* [Google for "dotfiles"](https://www.google.nl/search?q=dotfiles)
* [Archlinux collection](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles)
* Tip: search for a filename on GitHub, e.g. [in:path .gitconfig](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=Code&q=in%3Apath+.gitconfig).
